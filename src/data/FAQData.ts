    question: 'How does per-event pricing work?',
    answer: 'You pay once per event project. Each event gets its own separate pricing, so you can create multiple event projects and pay for each one individually.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?',
    answer: 'You can upgrade to a higher tier for any specific event project. Each project is priced independently, so you have full flexibility.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my videos after payment?',
    answer: 'Once you upgrade and pay for an event project, you get lifetime access to download and share your videos. Premium and Professional tiers include full download rights.'
